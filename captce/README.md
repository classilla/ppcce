This is a lightly modified version of Eiichiro Ito's [CaptCE](https://github.com/EiichiroIto/WindowsCESoftware/tree/main/CaptCE) patched by Cameron Kaiser to build under Platform Builder 2.11. If you use the provided workspace, only the PowerPC target is enabled. A build is in `bin/`.

To use CaptCE, start the program. A little camera will appear in the system tray. Each time you tap or click it, a file named `CAPT####.bmp` numbered sequentially will appear in `\windows`. Most screen dimensions and colour depths are supported. To exit CaptCE, hold down Alt and click or tap the camera, and the program will exit.
