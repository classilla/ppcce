# Some Windows CE ports

Some ports I created to test the PowerPC-based [Data General WiiN-PAD](https://oldvcr.blogspot.com/2024/05/with-powerpc-windows-ce-and-wiin-pad.html). They build with Platform Builder 2.11, or you can fetch sample builds from the `bin/` directory in each project folder. Licenses and available architectures may vary.
